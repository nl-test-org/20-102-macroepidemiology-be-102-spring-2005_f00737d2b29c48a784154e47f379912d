The assignments in this class consist of a major analytic term paper, produced in stages during the term, plus a few discrete problem sets.

The epidemiological data and analysis program found in the [Tools]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/tools) page is used extensively in these assignments.

Problem Sets
------------

Problem Set 1: ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/problem_set1))

Problem Set 2 (optional): ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/problem_set2))

Problem Set 3: ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/problem_set3))

Term Paper
----------

Each student chooses a common disease such as a form of cancer, vascular disease or diabetes of interest to him or her. Every three weeks a "chapter" is due in draft form with references developed in parallel with material from class that uses colon and lung cancer as principle examples. A "chapter" would be on the order of four-five pages of discussion of the key facts about the chosen disease.
